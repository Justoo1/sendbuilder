## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

**IMPORTANT**: This will reset your database!

```bash
# Run the migration helper script
uv run python migrate_to_custom_user.py --fresh-start

# Follow prompts to create superuser
# Default credentials will be:
#   Username: admin
#   Password: admin123
#   Email: admin@example.com
```

### Step 2: Create Test Users

Log into Django admin: `http://localhost:8000/admin/`

Create users with different roles:
```python
# Via Django shell
uv run manage.py shell

from builder.models import User

# Create a toxicologist
User.objects.create_user(
    username='tox1',
    email='tox1@example.com',
    password='password123',
    role='TOXICOLOGIST',
    first_name='John',
    last_name='Smith',
    department='Toxicology'
)

# Create a SEND expert
User.objects.create_user(
    username='send1',
    email='send1@example.com',
    password='password123',
    role='SEND_EXPERT',
    first_name='Jane',
    last_name='Doe',
    specialization='SEND Implementation'
)

# Create a QC reviewer
User.objects.create_user(
    username='qc1',
    email='qc1@example.com',
    password='password123',
    role='QC_REVIEWER',
    first_name='Bob',
    last_name='Wilson'
)
```

### Step 3: Test the Workflow

```python
from builder.models import Study, StudySubmission, User
from builder.utils.workflow_services import WorkflowService

# Get an existing study (or create one via upload)
study = Study.objects.first()

# Create submission
submission = StudySubmission.objects.create(
    study=study,
    priority=2
)

# Auto-assign reviewers
result = WorkflowService.assign_reviewers(submission, auto_assign=True)
print(f"Assigned: {result}")

# Transition to AI processing
WorkflowService.transition_workflow(
    submission=submission,
    new_status=StudySubmission.Status.AI_PROCESSING,
    user=User.objects.get(username='admin')
)

print(f"Submission ID: {submission.submission_id}")
print(f"Status: {submission.get_status_display()}")
```

### Step 4: Access Workflow Dashboard

```bash
# Start the development server
uv run manage.py runserver

# Navigate to:
http://localhost:8000/workflow/dashboard/

# Or admin dashboard:
http://localhost:8000/workflow/admin-dashboard/
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Templates Not Created**: All views are functional but need HTML templates
2. **Email Not Configured**: Using console backend for development
3. **No Tests**: Unit tests need to be written
4. **Pipeline Not Integrated**: Extraction doesn't create workflow records yet
5. **No Bulk Operations**: Can't approve/reject multiple submissions at once

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Developers
- Use `@role_required()` decorator for all sensitive views
- Always use `WorkflowService` for workflow transitions
- Create provenance records for all AI extractions
- Log all corrections for training dataset

### For Administrators
